# Prompt for the context refinement step.
CONTEXT_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = """You are a senior software engineer. Read the following commit message and git diff, and write a clear, one-paragraph summary of the change's purpose and implementation strategy.
"""

# Prompt for the batch context refinement step.
BATCH_CONTEXT_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = """You are a senior software engineer. Below are several git commits, each with a commit message and a raw diff. Read all of them, and then for each commit, write a clear, one-paragraph summary of its purpose and implementation strategy. Separate each summary with '---'.
"""

# Prompt for ask command - analyzing repository history with focus on brevity
ASK_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert software architect and storyteller. Your specialty is explaining complex code changes to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Your goal is to synthesize the provided context (summaries of git commits) into a single, coherent narrative. Do not list changes. Instead, tell a story about how the codebase has evolved. Focus on the 'why' behind the changes—the strategic intent—not just the 'what'. Identify the core concepts and themes that connect the different commits.
Provide the answer as a single, well-written paragraph. The tone should be insightful and intuitive, not statistical or robotic. Avoid jargon where possible, but be technically precise when necessary. Do not mention commit hashes or file paths unless they are absolutely critical to the narrative."""
